# WordPress-Template
A base template for WordPress projects

The theme has been adapted from [Todd Motto's HTML5 Blank Theme](http://html5blank.com).


## STRUCTURE

The theme uses SASS and Gulp.

There is a src folder for use during development, and a dist folder for production.

The compiled style.css file is located in the dist/css/ folder.

There are set Gulp build tasks to optimize files once ready for production. The files will be automatically moved to the dist folder when running the build tasks.


## GETTING STARTED

Clone the theme into your Wordpress installation themes folder.

CD into the theme folder.

Run **NPM INSTALL** to get the Node packages. 

Run **BOWER INSTAL**L to get the Bower packages.

Run **GULP** to build and start watching files for changes.
